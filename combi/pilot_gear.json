Designed for carrying out and defending against boarding actions, the Madrigal system is modular and can be adjusted to tackle varied tactical situations. While inferior to heavier, dedicated boarding hardsuits and mechs such as the IPS-N Caliban and the Harrison Armory Kutuzov, the Madrigal yet boasts an impressive degree of personal protection without sacrificing mobility or agility. Compact enough to be worn in a mech’s cockpit, the Madrigal is slowly but steadily encroaching on the pilot hardsuits market. Its superior protection, armaments, and auxiliary systems make it an attractive choice for lancers everywhere.",

This is the higher-powered version of the HHS-075, designed to phase out the “Daisy Cutter” by providing comparable stopping power in a format that can be more easily supplied to armies in the field. The Cannibal should be used with caution around mixed units of friendlies, as its ejection action clears the weapon’s barrels of spent cartridges with enough velocity to decapitate unarmored personnel.",

Originally rigged up as a last resort by Xiong Xiaoli, this fistmounted system repurposes a mech reactor’s primary heat vent into a directional, engagement-proximity weapon. The production line D/D 288 must be primed before firing, requiring a dangerous power draw from the mechs’ systems; Trunk Security’s reportage of the recovery mission assumes that using this weapons is what killed Xiong Xiaoli and cored the White Tiger’s gunboat. The D/D 288’s ability to cause enormous collateral damage and its spectacular discharge when fired have earned it the moniker ‘Shā mǎ zhǎng’ or Horse-Killing Palm among MSMC pilots.",

Rather than attempting to replace it outright, CentComm\u0027s Defense Logistics Committee has put out a call for a supplementary standardized battle rifle system that can operate alongside the MC-AR in mixed fireteams, or as a primary weapon system for engaging heavily armored opposition at longer ranges than the MC-TR thermal rifle. The XC-BR uses an advanced caseless electrochemical propellant design capable of firing larger-caliber, armor-defeating rounds while minimizing recoil along with an integrated dynamic targeting system, though the weapon is still plagued by intermittent heat issues that can adversely affect performance.\u003c/p\u003e",

In the case of the plasma maul, they are mounted in rows along a reinforced haft and set to discharge on contact, making this a devastating closequarters weapon limited only by its need to recharge between strikes. Early models featured ejectable capacitor banks, but contemporary versions are designed to draw power directly from a chassis’ reactor.",

All the same, its heavy, highvelocity rounds remain extremely effective at defeating both armor and static defenses at extreme range.",

        "description":  "The “steelpunch”, as it’s affectionately known, is a twin-beam directed-energy weapon developed by HUC engineers for use against the heavily reinforced hulls of remnant chassis and other hardened targets. The earliest models were derived from Second Committee–era mineral surveying lasers. An initial beam flash-vaporizes the target’s outer layer and the plasma bloom is instantly analyzed for material density and structural composition, following which the needlebeam fires a focused, highintensity pulsed beam tuned to defeat heavy armor. Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved.",

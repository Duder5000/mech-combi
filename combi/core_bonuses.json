        "description":  "The Order of Leander is a Leandric States Alliance commendation given to those who have shown \"exemplary character, courage, and determination under great adversity.\" While primarily a military citation, precedent exists for it to be awarded to civilians as well, with a number of noteworthy historical figures having earned it for efforts during natural disasters, search-and-rescue missions, and medical crises. In Cressidium\u0027s settled history, no one from any other world has ever earned this award, but whether you come from beyond the stars or not, for your service in defense of both the LSA as well as Cressidium you have earned the right to wear it with pride."

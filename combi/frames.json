        "description":  "Following the commercial failure of the Raleigh, several third parties found themselves with the opportunity of buying out development rights for the license as IPS-N sought to recoup initial costs. One of the companies that found itself in this position, Anton Industries, had fallen on hard times after its CEO vanished in mysterious circumstances, leading to plummeting stocks. \u003cbr\u003eChasing a lucky break and seizing the opportunity, Anton Industries began work on what would ultimately be the last frame ever to be developed under its name. Basing the modifications to the Raleigh on one of its own mechs – the Hades Mk3 – Anton Industries quickly developed the frame into a capable combined-arms platform emphasizing speed and rapid deployment. Instead of the Raleigh’s integrated Mjolnir, a weapon far too heavy for the new doctrinal approach, the modified chassis sports an internal reservoir of TRUESILVER nanites, a proprietary whitewash product capable of enhancing a weapon’s destructive power on a strike-to-strike basis. \u003cbr\u003eThe resulting mech was named “Störtebeker” after an old Cradle legend in a fit of gallows humor regarding the company’s less than ideal position. The frame, just like its namesake, ultimately spelled doom for the company, despite its relative success. \u003cbr\u003eQuickly gaining popularity among mercenaries, black-ops units, and bounty hunters alike, the Störtebeker became the frame of choice for those requiring speed and maneuverability out of an IPS-N base but who preferred a solid ranged component over the Nelson’s dedicated close-combat focus. \u003cbr\u003eIPS-N itself, interested in the Störtebeker, eventually decided to buy out the smaller company and, indifferent to Anton Industries’ other projects and subsidiaries, cannibalized the company in its entirety. Thus, the Störtebeker, now licensed fully as a Raleigh variant-frame under the IPS-N label, stands as a testament to a company’s destruction and how sometimes, one can do well and fail because of it.",

Originally developed under the moniker “MicroMonarch”, the scaled-down frame is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and sports the high-quality engineering expected from all SSC mechs. Where the Monarch focuses on devastating long-range firepower, the Viceroy is more akin to a close-range brawler, using its sophisticated near-threat targeting arrays to wield the launchers of its sibling with deadly precision. \u003cbr\u003eEquipped with a scaled-down version of the Monarch’s own SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System, the Viceroy is more than capable of saturating an area around itself with relatively small but high-yield warheads, aimed with pinpoint accuracy. \u003cbr\u003eThis, coupled with an integrated, one-use burst jump pack, turns the Viceroy into a potent shock trooper with devastating first-strike capabilities. This role is supported by its ability to shrug off any potential self-inflicted harm from any “shock and awe” maneuvers thanks to its advanced blast-resistant armor plating. \u003cbr\u003eSince its recent official release, the Viceroy has become – by SSC standards – an affordable frame that is now being widely rolled out to various SSC associates and subsidiaries. Slated to be approved for mass production, it is anticipated the Viceroy will become a frontline “soldier” mech to ultimately rival the likes of Harrison Armory’s Sherman.",

Its ubiquity does not bely its reliability and durability, nor its iconic status as the line mech of the baronies. Due to a trade negotiation with Smith-Shimano corpro, the Orchis is compatible with the Black Witch licensing scheme and can appropriate the majority of its gear and weaponry. Utilizing ancient and sturdy mag-lock technology, the Orchis wields a heavy Scuta shield, reinforced to deflect incoming fire. This shield can be locked in place and braced against another shield of its own kind, creating a tessellated wall of impenetrable strength. The half-mile long shield walls of the throne guard, blazoned with their house emblems, are an iconic and terrifying sight in Baronic history. The kuirassers of the Baronies decorate their Orchii with house heraldry, war banners, and trophies of past conflicts, each one the avatar resplendent with the regalia of a decorated warrior.",

Easily hidden, these “Slag Bombs”, as Karrakin security forces were soon to call them, are capable of incinerating their close surroundings in an instant. When properly supported by a group of K-PG frames the Salamander becomes a terrifying force multiplier as it sets up Slag Bombs that are easily detonated by the smaller mechs. While the exact mechanisms behind the mutation of a K-PG into a S-PG are unknown, experts in the field of Pattern Group research suggest that the Salamander represents an evolved, mature form that all K-PGs reach given time. While verification of this theory remains outstanding, it may have staggering implications regarding the underlying nature of the liturgicode responsible for the K-PG.",

An older frame, only slightly younger than the Mk1 “Worldkiller”, the Habsburg was the line of mechanized chassis that eventually developed into the famous “Saladin”. Though it sports many similar defensive systems to the Saladin, the technology utilized in the Habsburg is much more crude and unrefined than one would expect from a contemporary Harrison Armory frame.",

        "description":  "\u003cp\u003eOriginally commissioned as a dueling mech by the Baronic Houses of Smoke and Order, the Atlas blurs the line between mechanized chassis and powered personal armor. Thanks to a long-running research project from SSC\u0027s Exotic Materials Group, the designers were able to employ the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech: the result was a chassis that resembled a large, sleek hardsuit, almost skintight in places. While the Atlas sacrifices the durability of a larger frame, its essential systems are so closely melded with its user\u0027s movements that it offers unparalleled maneuverability.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough the Atlas was initially licensed only to Baronic clients, its design was leaked when a group of ExoMat personnel lost a suit to a Sparri espada in an intense game of Kapkat. Despite their initial attempt to recover the suit, SSC relented, citing the eager demand from Sparri groups for access to the full license. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConsidered the perfect warrior frame for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, the Atlas now enjoys a dual reputation among both the Sparri peoples and Karrakin nobility. To the Sparri, the Atlas \u0026ndash; its combat efficacy notwithstanding \u0026ndash; is highly valued for the direct access its systems allow to their ancestral memory; Atlas frames on Sparr are the heirlooms of great warriors, tied to family (blood and chosen) and maintained by hand. Each suit on Sparr bears the history of its previous pilots in both decorations and FCA-compliant machine learning, which enables Sparri hunters to almost literally call upon their ancestors in battle. The Atlas has become so popular among the Sparri that they even developed a new martial art based on the Atlas: Jäger Kunst. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Karrakin nobility, on the other hand, find the Atlas to be a perfect machine for noble heroism \u0026ndash; that the Sparri have an affinity for it only makes the chassis that much more desirable among Karrakin Sparrist scholars. Commonly decorated with purchased Sparri saga discs, Vast pelts, and saga lines, Karrakin suits blend imagined profiles of Annorum Passacaglia and Annorum Tyrannus-era heroes with profiles of Sparri warriors, daredevils, vast-hunters, and espadas.\u003c/p\u003e",

Unlike many of IPS-N\u0027s modern frames, the Caliban was designed from the ground up to be a military machine. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Caliban is IPS-N\u0027s solution to the  \"Yemanova \" Problem, more properly known as the Impact-Override Problem. Capital ships, the problem posits, are incredibly expensive, demand a tremendous amount of time for corpros and Diasporan states to produce and maintain, and increasingly outmatched by anti-ship weaponry. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this makes many commanders gun-shy, encouraging them to rely on subline vessels and fighters to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships. This strategy tends to prove just as expensive: instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed, signifying the end of a battle, engagements can grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. The corpro\u0027s designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon. It needed to be well-armed and well-armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this need. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCultural critics argue that mechanized chassis venerate the form of a particular humanity; it is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUnlike many IPS-N frames, the Caliban has no roots in early attempts at self-defense by freighter crews and asteroid miners. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, or the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth. It has no civilian applications in aid, disaster relief, construction, or farming; it does not build, defend, or inspire \u0026ndash; it was designed to solve a numbers problem on a ledger. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is a tool designed to kill human beings very, very quickly. \u003c/p\u003e",

The steaming, shuddering final result of K-PG exposure is an ugly affair: a device transformed from plow to blade by powerful, viral-morph liturgicode that is almost impossible for conventional codec sniffers to capture pre-print. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe clandestine mechanisms by which the Kobold is transmitted and applied make it the perfect machine for fighting Baronic suppression forces. The desperate workers who printed the first Kobolds found them to be eminently fungible. When loaded into their mining exos and chassis, the K-PG code repurposed reactors and industrial tools to deadly effect, weaponizing the very materials and superstructures that powered it. The rapid flash-melting, processing, and extruding of raw material into molten plural-state particles is dangerous \u0026ndash; often just as dangerous to its pilot as the final product is to its targets. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOperational dangers notwithstanding, the Ungratefuls who first adopted the K-PG stunned their Baronic overseers with a series of rapid and total victories, liberating a great swath of lunar helium-3 mines. While the insurgency was eventually contained to Bo, it continues, necessitating the deployment of the House of Dust\u0027s Graveborn Banner Company for counter-insurgency operations beyond the capability of local security forces. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHORUS\u0027s assets in the Long Rim continue to produce K-PG liturgicode seeds. The House of Dust has contracted Mastodon to track down and eliminate HORUS elements in the area; meanwhile, Harrison Armory has reached out to the Brigade-Legion to counter the House of Dust\u0027s efforts. \u003c/p\u003e",

Pilots approved to fabricate and field-test Sunzi components are monitored remotely by the Armory\u0027s Special Projects Group, which enjoys wide latitude in gathering telemetry and biometric data. The Sunzi platform is considered by Harrison Armory to still be in development, and not yet available for fleet contracts. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLike the Armory\u0027s Napoleon chassis before it, the Sunzi utilizes the Armory\u0027s H-GOBLIN-derived recursive-mesh interdermal substrate, allowing it to mount outsized weapons and systems on a chassis measuring just over three meters tall. Where it differs is in its technological heritage. The Napoleon was largely the product of the Armory\u0027s internal paracausal/ parallel space research and development groups; the Sunzi is rumored to be derived from stolen and extracted Volador technology. This may explain why the Long Rim and the Dawnline Shore are the primary test grounds for the platform \u0026ndash; far from Union\u0027s most direct oversight, the Armory may have more time to make what progress it can before Union\u0027s regulatory impulse catches up to them. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to Union NavInt reports on the Sunzi, the platform\u0027s unshielded emissions are consistent with known blinkspace signatures; corroborating intelligence from undercover elements inside the program\u0027s main campus on Ras Shamra show that the Sunzi\u0027s development has been fast-tracked to respond to the evolving situation in the Dawnline Shore. Both as a forcemultiplication tool to assist the Armory\u0027s legionary presence across the Shore, and more specifically to counter the Ungratefuls\u0027 newest weapon there, Object L (see UNI Report CORPSE GATE for more). \u003c/p\u003e",

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong\u0027s personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC\u0027s report. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger\u0027s attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eXiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy\u0027s initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger\u0027s cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh\u0027s plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eXiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \"Xiong Limit\" of 45+ confirmed kills. \u003c/p\u003e",

One of the earliest of these successor programs, the Kutuzov was designed for Armory Naval Command as a boarding action force multiplier, taking the Napoleon\u0027s incredible self-sustainability and turning it outwards to create a compact and maneuverable projected defense platform ideal for accompanying marine or chassis squads into close-quarters engagements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike the more iconic Saladin, the Kutuzov remains unsuited to frontline engagement, and its own personal survivability metrics are notably reduced from the Napoleon itself. However, its robust array of waveform projectors are designed for sustained operation under even critical system stresses, and its ability to rapidly disseminate flash-projected barriers in response to incoming fire have shown extremely promising results both during training exercises as well as limited live-combat engagements during anti-piracy operations. Alongside the Iskander-CC, the Kutuzov has also begun to see increasing use as a perimeter security and riot-control unit during low-intensity defensive actions on New Madrassa.",

        "description":  "\u003cp\u003eA sidegraded cousin of IPS-N\u0026rsquo;s Lancaster support frame, the Kidd was produced under a joint development contract by IPS-N\u0026rsquo;s Titan\u0026ndash;Enceladus Field Project and Northstar Branch Robotics. The original pattern for the frame was bought off a mining commune that had rigged their support drones in a slapdash but ingenious neural mesh that both hardened them against tech intrusion and increased their operational efficiency many times over. Urban legend was that the original builder of the rig had used his drone team to bury caches of black-market Volador tech in several wandering asteroids, and out of extreme paranoia made his systems almost impossible to crack. To this day Northstar Branch Robotics tries valiantly to squash down persistent rumors that clues to the location of the caches are hidden in the Kidd\u0026rsquo;s code base.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDesigned to provide an aggressive, all-theater support solution to rugged field teams in hostile environments, the Kidd mounts a trio of powerful systems to ensure a broad operational envelope. The Jolly Roger semiautonomous personal orbital platform, bundled with every genuine-license Kidd platform establishes theater control in any open or near-surface environment. A squadron of bundled subalterns (along with an onboard maintenance suite) guarantees friendly support in any environment and provides a broad suite of tactical possibility. Finally, Titan\u0026ndash;Enceladus\u0026rsquo;s SMOKESTACK heat sink pylon represents the cutting edge of IPS-N\u0026rsquo;s thermodynamic axiomatics, allowing users to offset surplus heat via the creation of a pinhole-window into an omega state of absolute zero.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Kidd is a popular chassis in Evergreen where it is employed as a subaltern command platform for civilian and engineering purposes. Its familiar bulk can also regularly be seen accompanying traders on their way to do business with the Gray Towns.\u003c/p\u003e",

Deployed in limited numbers against the remaining Egregorian hives in the brutal last stages of the war, the Enkidu\u0026rsquo;s neurological interfacing was dangerous: raw and unshielded. The power and aggression flowing through the subroutines that govern the mech bled into its pilot\u0026rsquo;s subjectivity, making them lose themselves in a storm of violence, constantly pushing themselves to greater and greater acts of destruction. This effect was incredibly hard for pilots to handle \u0026ndash; the fallout rate from the program was extremely high, and the survivors required extensive conditioning, implants, and a cocktail of neurological suppressants to continue.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe true aim of the Enkidu program was not to fight Egregorians, which were in the final stages of practical extinction, but to use the battlefield as a testing ground for the eventual deployment of the chassis against ThirdComm revolutionaries and dissidents. Though the codebase for the Enkidu was eventually discontinued and molded into what is now the Tokugawa, the difficulties with the initial project prevented it from getting off the ground before the revolution took hold. The remaining prototypes were buried along with the rest of Hercynia\u0026rsquo;s history.\u003c/p\u003e",
